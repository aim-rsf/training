This repository contains the materials for the upcoming [AIM RSF](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility) workshop series on version control.

There are three workshops in this series, all taking place on consecutive Wednesday from 14:30 to 16:30 BST in June and July 2023.
- Introduction to version control with `git`
- Introduction to GitHub
- Collaborating with others using GitHub

You can find the slides that were used in the sessions in the `slides` folder.
The `walk-throughs` folder contains files with the steps taken during the interactive parts of the workshops and shows how to perform the equivalent actions using the command line.
