This repository contains the materials for the [AIM RSF](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility) workshop series on version control, delivered by **Eirini Zormpa** and **Rachael Stickland** with support from **Paola Galdi**.

There are three workshops in this series, all taking place on consecutive Wednesday from 14:30 to 16:30 BST in June and July 2023.
- Introduction to version control with `git`
- Introduction to GitHub
- Collaborating with others using GitHub

You can find the slides that were used in the sessions in the `slides` folder.
The `walk-throughs` folder contains files with the steps taken during the interactive parts of the workshops and shows how to perform the equivalent actions using the command line.

The recordings of the sessions are on YouTube:
