### Ingredients
- 3 strips thick-cut, naturally cured bacon
- 2 slices high-quality sandwich bread
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 to 4 thick slices ripe tomato
- Coarse sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Method
1. Place a griddle or skillet over medium-low heat. Add bacon and place a bacon press, skillet, or masonry trowel on top of it to keep it flat as it cooks. Cook until lightly browned on first side, about 5 minutes, then flip, cover again, and continue cooking until bacon is browned on both sides and fat has rendered, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer bacon to a paper towel–lined plate and set aside
2. Place bread on same skillet or griddle and toast in bacon fat over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until evenly browned on first side. Flip and brown second side.
3. Lay toasted bread on a work surface and spread mayonnaise on both top faces. Layer tomato slices on 1 piece of bread and sprinkle generously with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper.
4. Break bacon slices in half and layer them onto the sandwich in 2 layers of 3 half slices each, alternating the orientation of bacon in each layer for more structural stability. Close sandwich and cut in half diagonally. Serve immediately.
