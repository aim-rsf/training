## Learning objectives
- ✅ To expand the definition of “research outputs”
- ✅ To define the FAIR principles
- ✅ To explain how to choose a repository
- ✅ To demonstrate how to use a repository for archiving research outputs

These slides are partly based on the slides used for a workshop on [FAIR and Frictionless workflows for tabular data](https://github.com/eirini-zormpa/frictionless-data-workshop).

The images folder includes visualisation created by Scriberia for the Turing Way for convenience.
